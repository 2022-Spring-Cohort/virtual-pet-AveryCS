Game instructions!

Welcome to Mythical Creatureland! 

Based on your favorite color, you will be paired with your own individual unicorn (dog) or centaur (cat)!

Once you have been assigned your mythical creature, you can play with it individually- or you can engage with all 
of the pets in the shelter. You can see what animals are currently in the shelter, and even add or adopt 
mythical creatures.

Things to note:
-Every creature begins with all levels at 5 (ie hunger, thirst, etc)
The game ends based on the following conditions:
    -If boredom, hunger, rest, or thirst levels go less than -5 or greater than 10 (or 15) for all animals
    -For organic animals, if the need cleaning levels is greater than or equal to 10
    -For robotic animals, if the need maintenance levels is greater than or equal to 10
-Walking organic pets decreases their need cleaning levels
-Walking robotic pets increases their need for oil and maintenance

Have fun and happy playing!
